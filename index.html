   <h3>1. What are promises and why do we need them?</h3>
<p>
    
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. <br>
 It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. <br>
  This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, <br>
   the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. <br><br>
   Benefits of Promises  <br>

1.	Improves Code Readability <br>
2.	Better handling of asynchronous operations <br>
3.	Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic <br>
4.	Better Error Handling 
</p>
<h4>Example--</h4>
<pre>
    var promise=new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
        let x=10;
        let y=10;
        if(x===y){
            resolve();
        }
        else{
            reject();
        }
    })
    promise.then(function(){
        console.log("equal");
    }).catch(function(){
        console.log("not equal")
    });
</pre>

<h3>2. What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</h3>
<p>
    
An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. <br>
 The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, <br>
  avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

</p>
<h4>Example--</h4>
<pre>
    async function f() {

        let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
        });
      
        let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)
      
        alert(result); // "done!"
      }
      
      f();
</pre>
<h3>3. What is hoisting?</h3>
<p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. <br>
     JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.</p>
     <pre>
        console.log(hello); //output : undefined
          var hello = 'The variable Has been hoisted';
</pre>
<p>The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,</p>
<pre>
    var hello;
console.log(hello);
hello = 'The variable Has been hoisted';

</pre>
<h3>4. What is the DOM?</h3>
<p>
    DOM stands for Document Object Model,(DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. <br>
     It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. <br>
      The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
</p>
<h3>5.  Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
<p>Undefined- <br>
    undefined is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. <br>
     JavaScript assigns undefined to any variable that has been declared but not initialized or defined.
   </p>
   <pre>
    let hello;
    console.log(hello); //Undefined
   </pre>
   <p>Not defined- <br>
    A not defined is a variable that is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, let, or const.
 </p>
 <pre>
    let hello = 25;
console.log(hi) // hi is not defined
 </pre>
 <p> NaN- <br>
   it is "not a number".it represents a value which is not a valid number.
 </p>
 <pre>
    console.log("hi"/5);//NaN
    console.log(Math.sqrt(-1))//nan
 </pre>
 <h3>6. How many operators do we have in JS ?</h3>
 <p>
    We have 6 types of operators in JS they are <br> <br>

    1.	Arithmetic Operators <br>
    2.	Comparison Operators <br>
    3.	Logical Operators <br>
    4.	Assignment Operators <br>
    5.	Conditional Operators <br>
    6.	Ternary Operator
    </p>
    <h3>7. What are pure functions?</h3>
    <p>
        Pure Function is a function (a block of code ) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. <br>
         It does not depend on any state, or data change during a programâ€™s execution rather it only depends on its input arguments.
    </p>
    <pre>
        function pure(i) {
            console.log(i * 4);//it will always return 16 for input 4.
          }
          pure(4);
               
    </pre>
    <h3>8. What is callback hell</h3>
    <p>
        Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks <br>
         which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic.
    </p>
    <pre>
        function printNums(){
            setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log("1");
                setTimeout(()=>{
                    console.log("2");
                    setTimeout(()=>{
                        console.log("3");
        
                        setTimeout(()=>{
                            console.log("4");
        
                            setTimeout(()=>{
                                console.log("5");
                              setTimeout(()=>{
                                  console.log("6");
        
                                  setTimeout(()=>{
                                      console.log("7");
                                     
                                          console.log("End of Callback hell");
                                
                                  },1000)
                              },1000)
                            },1000)
                        },1000);
                    },1000);
                },1000);
            },1000);
        }

        What is promise chaining
    </p>
    <pre>
        new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

            setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
          
          }).then(function(result) {
          
            console.log(result); // 1
            return result * 2;
          
          }).then(function(result) {
          
            console.log(result); // 2
            return result * 3;
          
          }).then(function(result) {
          
            console.log(result); // 6
            return result * 4;
          
          });
          
          
    </pre>

    <h3>10. What are arrow functions?</h3>
    <p>
        it is one of the featured introduced in ES6 version of js.it is basically an alterante to the regular function expression.
        it allows us to create function in a cleaner way.
        it is also an anonymous function since it doesnt have any name.
    </p>
    <pre>
        let x = function(x, y) {
            return x * y;
        }
     x(4,5)
            
    </pre>
    <h3>11. Give an example of async/await</h3>
    <pre>
        async function foo(){
            let promise=new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
                setTimeout(()=>resolve("resolved"),2000);
            })
            let result=await promise;
            console.log(result);
        }
        foo();
        // expected output: "resolved"

    </pre>
